## Overview

This repository contains implementations of popular vision architectures from scratch using PyTorch. Each model is implemented with clean, readable, and well-documented code, making it easy to understand the underlying mechanics of each architecture.

### Architectures Implemented:

- [VGG16](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/vgg16.py)
- [VGG19](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/vgg19.py)
- [GoogLeNet](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/googlenet.py)
- [ResNet18](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/resnet18.py)
- [ResNet34](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/resnet34.py)
- [ResNet50](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/resnet50.py)
- [ResNet101](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/resnet101.py)
- [ResNet152](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/resnet152.py)
- More to come...

## Motivation

As part of my deep learning journey, I am implementing popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures from scratch to better understand their workings and contribute to the open-source community. This repository serves as a resource for anyone looking to learn about or utilize these architectures in their projects.
