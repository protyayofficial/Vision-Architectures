## Overview

This repository contains implementations of popular vision architectures from scratch using PyTorch. Each model is implemented with clean, readable, and well-documented code, making it easy to understand the underlying mechanics of each architecture.

### Architectures Implemented:
- [AlexNet](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/alexnet.py)
- [VGG16](https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures/blob/main/vgg16.py)
- More to come...

## Motivation

As part of my deep learning journey, I am implementing popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures from scratch to better understand their workings and contribute to the open-source community. This repository serves as a resource for anyone looking to learn about or utilize these architectures in their projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.9.0+
- Torchvision (optional, for datasets)
- `torchsummary` (optional, for model summaries)

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/protyayofficial/Vision-Architectures.git
cd Vision-Architectures-main
```

Install the Necessary dependencies: 
```
pip install torch torchvision
pip install torchsummary
```
